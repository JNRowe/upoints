``upoints``
===========

:mod:`upoints` is a collection of `GPL v3`_ licensed modules for working
with points on Earth, or other near spherical objects.  It allows you to
calculate the distance and bearings between points, mangle
xearth_/xplanet_ data files, work with online UK trigpoint databases,
NOAA_'s weather station database and other such location databases.

Previous versions of :mod:`upoints` were called ``earth_distance``, but
the name was changed as it no longer reflected the majority of uses the
packages was targeted at.
