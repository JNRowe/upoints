C{earth_distance} is a collection of GPL v2 licensed modules for working with
points on a spherical object.  It allows you to calculate the distance and
bearings between points, mangle U{xearth
<http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~tuna/xearth/>}/U{xplanet
<http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/>} data files, work with online UK trigpoint
databases, U{GNU miscfiles <http://www.gnu.org/directory/miscfiles.html>} city
databases and U{NOAA <http://weather.noaa.gov/>}'s weather station database.

The C{earth_distance.point} module is the simplest interface available, and is
mainly useful as a naÃ¯ve object for simple calculation and for subclassing for
specific usage.  An example of how to use it follows:

>>> Home = point.Point(52.015, -0.221)
>>> Telford = point.Point(52.6333, -2.5000)
>>> int(Home.distance(Telford))
169
>>> int(Home.bearing(Telford))
294
>>> int(Home.final_bearing(Telford))
293
>>> import datetime
>>> Home.sun_events(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
(datetime.time(3, 42), datetime.time(20, 25))
>>> Home.sunrise(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
datetime.time(3, 42)
>>> Home.sunset(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
datetime.time(20, 25)
